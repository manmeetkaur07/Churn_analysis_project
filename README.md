# 📊 Telecommunication End-to-End Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Background

Our company, a subscription-based service provider, is facing a significant business challenge: **customer churn**.  
Churn occurs when customers stop using our service, and it is a major concern because acquiring a new customer is far more expensive than retaining an existing one.

This project is a strategic effort to **understand and combat churn** by analyzing customer data.  
We aim to uncover:

- **Who is leaving**
- **Why they are leaving**
- **Which customers are at risk of leaving in the future**

By turning data into actionable insights, this analysis empowers our **marketing and leadership teams** to create **targeted retention strategies** that improve customer loyalty and drive long-term business growth.
